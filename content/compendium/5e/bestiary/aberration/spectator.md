## Spectator

*Magic-Bound Beholder-Kin*

- **Habitat.** Underdark  
- **Treasure.** Any  

Invoking mysterious rites involving four beholder eyestalks, a spellcaster can mold aberrant dreams into a beholder-like guardian. Called a spectator, the being summoned by such a ritual resembles a beholder with five magical eyes—a central eye and four on stalks arrayed around the crown of the creature's spherical body.

A spectator serves its conjurer for 101 years by guarding something of the spellcaster's choice—typically a treasure or location. The spectator is a reliable guardian and allows only its summoner access to what it protects. A spectator might converse with other creatures, openly discussing its orders and the magic-user who conjured it, but it has no ambitions of its own and won't abandon its post. Should an intruder ignore its warnings, a spectator attempts to drive away the intruder with its magical eye rays.

At the end of its service, a spectator might discorporate back into nothingness or wander away, seeking to learn more of the multiverse.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The spectator uses Eye Rays twice.

***Bite.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* `dice:1d20+4|noform|noparens|text(+4)`, reach 5 ft. *Hit:* `dice:1d6+2|noform|noparens|avg|text(5)` (`1d6 + 2`) Piercing damage.

***Eye Rays.*** The spectator randomly shoots one of the following magical rays at a target it can see within 90 feet of itself (roll `dice:1d4|noform|noparens|avg` (`d4`); reroll if the spectator has already used that ray during this turn):

- **1 Confusion Ray.** *Wisdom Saving Throw:* DC 12. *Failure:* `dice:2d4|noform|noparens|avg|text(5)` (`2d4`) Psychic damage, and the target can't take Reactions until the end of its next turn. On its next turn, the target can't move, and it uses its action to make a melee or ranged attack against a randomly determined creature within range. If the target can't attack, it does nothing on that turn.  
- **2 Paralyzing Ray.** *Constitution Saving Throw:* DC 12. *Failure:* The target has the [Paralyzed](rules/5e/conditions.md#Paralyzed) condition and repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. After 1 minute, it succeeds automatically.  
- **3 Fear Ray.** *Wisdom Saving Throw:* DC 12. *Failure:* `dice:2d4|noform|noparens|avg|text(5)` (`2d4`) Psychic damage, and the target has the [Frightened](rules/5e/conditions.md#Frightened) condition until the end of its next turn.  
- **4 Wounding Ray.** *Constitution Saving Throw:* DC 12. *Failure:* `dice:3d10|noform|noparens|avg|text(16)` (`3d10`) Necrotic damage. *Success:* Half damage.  

## Reactions

***Spell Reflection.*** Trigger: The spectator succeeds on a saving throw against a spell, or a spell's attack roll misses it. _Response—_*Dexterity Saving Throw:* DC 12, one creature the spectator can see within 120 feet. *Failure:* `dice:3d6|noform|noparens|avg|text(10)` (`3d6`) Force damage.
