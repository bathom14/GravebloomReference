# Black Pudding

## Black Pudding

*Divisible, Corrosive Blob*

- **Habitat.** Underdark  
- **Treasure.** None  

Black puddings are shapeless masses of predatory cells. Once a pudding detects organic matter, it oozes toward its prey, dissolving living matter and various objects. If a black pudding is split by lightning or slashing attacks, it divides into two smaller, independent puddings.

Various supernatural conditions might bring black puddings into being. Roll on or choose a result from the Black Pudding Sources table to inspire a pudding's origins.

## Traits

***Amorphous.*** The pudding can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch without expending extra movement to do so.

***Corrosive Form.*** A creature that hits the pudding with a melee attack roll takes `dice:1d8|noform|noparens|avg|text(4)` (`d8`) Acid damage. Nonmagical ammunition is destroyed immediately after hitting the pudding and dealing any damage. Any nonmagical weapon takes a cumulative -1 penalty to attack rolls immediately after dealing damage to the pudding and coming into contact with it. The weapon is destroyed if the penalty reaches -5. The penalty can be removed by casting the [Mending](compendium/5e/spells/mending.md) spell on the weapon.

In 1 minute, the pudding can eat through 2 feet of nonmagical wood or metal.

***Spider Climb.*** The pudding can climb difficult surfaces, including along ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

## Actions

***Dissolving Pseudopod.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* `dice:1d20+5|noform|noparens|text(+5)`, reach 10 ft. *Hit:* `dice:4d6+3|noform|noparens|avg|text(17)` (`4d6 + 3`) Acid damage. Nonmagical armor worn by the target takes a -1 penalty to the AC it offers. The armor is destroyed if the penalty reduces its AC to 10. The penalty can be removed by casting the [Mending](compendium/5e/spells/mending.md) spell on the armor.

## Reactions

***Split.*** Trigger: While the pudding is Large or Medium and has 10+ [Hit Points](rules/5e/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md), it becomes [Bloodied](rules/5e/variant-rules/bloodied-xphb.md) or is subjected to Lightning or Slashing damage. _Response:_ The pudding splits into two new Black Puddings. Each new pudding is one size smaller than the original pudding and acts on its [Initiative](rules/5e/variant-rules/initiative-xphb.md). The original pudding's [Hit Points](rules/5e/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md) are divided evenly between the new puddings (round down).
