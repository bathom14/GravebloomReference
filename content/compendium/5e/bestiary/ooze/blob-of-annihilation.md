## Blob of Annihilation

*All-Consuming Cosmic Entropy Unleashed*

- **Habitat.** Any  
- **Treasure.** Any  

The blob of annihilation is a coagulation of cosmic entropy conjoined to the remains of dead gods. This malicious entity drifts through Wildspace and multiversal expanses inimical to life—vast regions where the chance of encountering it is low.

The blob poses the greatest threat when disasters or nihilistic magic-users summon it to inhabited realms. Once unleashed, the blob of annihilation rolls across the land in vast, cosmic gyres, with fragments of the blob splitting off to engulf targets. The blob consumes anything it encounters, sweeping forests, villages, and fortresses into its mass. Within the blob is an expanse without air or gravity where entropic forces destroy whatever they engulf. Nothing can survive within for long.

Only magic items and the corpses of gods and titans can endure inside the blob. Because of that fact, treasure hunters and theologians sometimes give themselves the deadly task of trying to retrieve something from within the blob. This quest usually ends in annihilation, but occasionally it results in the find of a lifetime.

When the blob appears, roll on or choose a result from the Blob of Annihilation Contents table to inspire what extraordinary thing remains within its goop.

## Traits

***Astral Implosion.*** If the blob is reduced to 0 [Hit Points](rules/5e/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md), it implodes and ejects any creatures and objects engulfed by it into the Astral Sea. The blob itself vanishes, leaving behind a layer of slime on everything that was within 600 feet of it. In `dice:1d20|noform|noparens|avg` (`d20`) years, the blob reconstitutes on a random world in the Material Plane.

***Legendary Resistance (4/Day).*** If the blob fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

***Magic Resistance.*** The blob has [Advantage](rules/5e/variant-rules/advantage-xphb.md) on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The blob makes two Pseudopod attacks and uses Engulf. It can replace one attack with a use of Restraining Glob.

***Pseudopod.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* `dice:1d20+15|noform|noparens|text(+15)`, reach 30 ft. *Hit:* `dice:3d10+8|noform|noparens|avg|text(24)` (`3d10 + 8`) Force damage.

***Engulf.*** The blob moves up to its [Speed](rules/5e/variant-rules/speed-xphb.md) and can move through the spaces of Huge or smaller creatures and objects. *Strength Saving Throw:* DC 23, each creature or object whose space the blob enters for the first time during this move. *Failure:* The target is engulfed. While engulfed, a target has [Total Cover](rules/5e/variant-rules/cover-xphb.md) against attacks and other effects outside the blob, and when the blob moves, the engulfed target moves with it. A nonmagical object is destroyed after spending 1 minute engulfed.

While engulfed, a creature takes `dice:6d6|noform|noparens|avg|text(21)` (`6d6`) Force damage at the start of each of its turns, is suffocating, has the [Restrained](rules/5e/conditions.md#Restrained) condition, and repeats the save at the end of each of its turns. An engulfed creature that is reduced to 0 [Hit Points](rules/5e/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md) dissolves into ash, which is ejected into the Astral Sea. *Success:* The target escapes and enters the nearest unoccupied space.

***Restraining Glob.*** The blob lobs a slimy glob at one Large or smaller creature it can see within 600 feet of itself. *Dexterity Saving Throw:* DC 23, the targeted creature. *Failure:* `dice:3d6+8|noform|noparens|avg|text(18)` (`3d6 + 8`) Acid damage. The glob rolls the target 60 feet straight toward the blob, and the target has the [Restrained](rules/5e/conditions.md#Restrained) condition until the end of its next turn, when the glob harmlessly dissolves. *Success:* Half damage only.

## Legendary Actions

***Decay.*** The blob deals `dice:4d6|noform|noparens|avg|text(14)` (`4d6`) Necrotic damage to each creature engulfed by it. The blob can't take this action again until the start of its next turn.

***Grasping Glob.*** The blob uses Restraining Glob. The blob can't take this action again until the start of its next turn.

***Lashing Goop.*** The blob makes one Pseudopod attack.
