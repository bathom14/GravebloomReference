# Vampire Nightbringer
*Source: Monster Manual (2024) p. 316*  

Born of necromantic rituals and planes of existence suffused with negative energy, vampire nightbringers manipulate shadows and feed on the raw life force of living creatures.

## Vampires

*Blood-Sucking Lords of the Night*

- **Habitat.** Underdark, Urban  
- **Treasure.** Any  

Vampires disguise their accursed, immortal natures, passing as mortals to feed on the blood of the living. While the youngest vampires might be little more than bloodthirsty servants of their creators, the eldest possess incredible cunning and control over supernatural forces of the night.

Undead vampires lie dormant during the day, retreating to resting places hidden from foes and the sun's searing rays. Roll on or choose a result from the Vampire Resting Places table to inspire a vampire's grim sanctuary.

### Vampire Lairs

Vampires and vampire umbral lords create sanctuaries apart from the living, whether hidden in cosmopolitan cities or sequestered in ruins where they dwelled in life.

## Traits

***Sunlight Hypersensitivity.*** The vampire takes 10 Radiant damage if it starts its turn in sunlight. While in sunlight, it has [Disadvantage](rules/5e/variant-rules/disadvantage-xphb.md) on attack rolls and ability checks.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The vampire makes one Bite attack and one Shadow Strike attack.

***Bite.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* `dice:1d20+7|noform|noparens|text(+7)`, reach 5 ft. *Hit:* `dice:1d6+4|noform|noparens|avg|text(7)` (`1d6 + 4`) Piercing damage plus `dice:3d6|noform|noparens|avg|text(10)` (`3d6`) Necrotic damage. The target's [Hit Point](rules/5e/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md) maximum decreases by an amount equal to the Necrotic damage taken, and the vampire regains [Hit Points](rules/5e/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md) equal to that amount.

***Shadow Strike.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* `dice:1d20+7|noform|noparens|text(+7)`, reach 5 ft. *Hit:* `dice:1d6+4|noform|noparens|avg|text(7)` (`1d6 + 4`) Slashing damage plus `dice:4d6|noform|noparens|avg|text(14)` (`4d6`) Cold damage.
