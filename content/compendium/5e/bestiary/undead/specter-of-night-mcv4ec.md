# Specter of Night
*Source: Monstrous Compendium Volume 3: 4: Eldraine Creatures*  

Like dark mirrors of Eldraine's archons (see "[Archon of Boundaries](compendium/5e/bestiary/celestial/archon-of-boundaries-mcv4ec.md)"), specters appear as shrouded figures mounted on horrific flying beasts. It is easy to look at a specter and imagine the rider in command of the mount, but the truth is the opposite; the flying horror is an Undead monster that scours the wilds for a knightly corpse. On finding one, the horror binds its essence to the dead body, giving the corpse the semblance of life as a rider. The two function as a single creature, more powerful for their unnatural union.

Humans of Eldraine view specters as heralds of death. Specters are said to utter a keening wail, mournful beyond all other sounds and audible only to those who are about to die.

## Traits

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If the specter fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

***Magic Resistance.*** The specter has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The specter uses Mournful Keening if available, then makes one Hooves attack and one Reaping Scythe attack.

***Hooves.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `dice:1d20+10|noform|noparens|text(+10)` to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* `dice:3d6+6|noform|noparens|avg|text(16)` (`3d6 + 6`) bludgeoning damage plus `dice:8d6|noform|noparens|avg|text(28)` (`8d6`) necrotic damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 18 Strength saving throw or have the [prone](rules/5e/conditions.md#Prone) condition.

***Mournful Keening (Recharge 6).*** The specter utters a keening wail, calling to those close to death. Each non-Undead creature within 120 feet of the specter must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature hears the wail and is marked for death.

A creature marked for death can't regain hit points, has disadvantage on death saving throws, and all attack rolls against it are made with advantage. This effect lasts for 1 minute or until the creature is targeted by a [remove curse](compendium/5e/spells/remove-curse.md) spell or similar magic.

***Reaping Scythe.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `dice:1d20+10|noform|noparens|text(+10)` to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* `dice:1d12+6|noform|noparens|avg|text(12)` (`1d12 + 6`) slashing damage plus `dice:8d6|noform|noparens|avg|text(28)` (`8d6`) necrotic damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or gain a level of [exhaustion](rules/5e/conditions.md#Exhaustion).
