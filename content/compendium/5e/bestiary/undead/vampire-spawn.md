# Vampire Spawn
*Source: Monster Manual (2024) p. 315. Available in the <span title='Systems Reference Document (5.2)'>SRD</span> and the Free Rules (2024)*  

Vampire spawn are newly created vampires. They have yet to fully master their abilities, and many are consumed by their thirst for blood. Vampire spawn might serve more powerful vampires or pursue their own depraved agendas.

## Vampires

*Blood-Sucking Lords of the Night*

- **Habitat.** Underdark, Urban  
- **Treasure.** Any  

Vampires disguise their accursed, immortal natures, passing as mortals to feed on the blood of the living. While the youngest vampires might be little more than bloodthirsty servants of their creators, the eldest possess incredible cunning and control over supernatural forces of the night.

Undead vampires lie dormant during the day, retreating to resting places hidden from foes and the sun's searing rays. Roll on or choose a result from the Vampire Resting Places table to inspire a vampire's grim sanctuary.

### Vampire Lairs

Vampires and vampire umbral lords create sanctuaries apart from the living, whether hidden in cosmopolitan cities or sequestered in ruins where they dwelled in life.

***Bite.*** *Constitution Saving Throw:* DC 14, one creature within 5 feet that is willing or that has the [Grappled](rules/5e/conditions.md#Grappled), [Incapacitated](rules/5e/conditions.md#Incapacitated), or [Restrained](rules/5e/conditions.md#Restrained) condition. *Failure:* `dice:1d4+3|noform|noparens|avg|text(5)` (`1d4 + 3`) Piercing damage plus `dice:3d6|noform|noparens|avg|text(10)` (`3d6`) Necrotic damage.
