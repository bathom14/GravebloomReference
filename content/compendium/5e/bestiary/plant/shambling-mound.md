## Shambling Mound

*Manifestation of Primeval Power*

- **Habitat.** Forest, Swamp  
- **Treasure.** None  

Shambling mounds—also known as "shamblers"—embody the tenacity of the wilderness, seeking only to consume and grow. These masses of vegetation rise up to half again as tall as a human and possess thick limbs and a vague head. As they move through bogs and undergrowth, they ensnare creatures that come within reach. Shambling mounds bury those they catch within their own forms as compost.

Strange circumstances might give rise to shambling mounds, transforming vegetation into hulks with rudimentary cunning. Such conditions include strikes from magical lightning, nature defending itself, or druidic curses. Roll on or choose a result from the Shambling Mound Cultivation table to inspire a shambling mound's origins and features.

## Traits

***Lightning Absorption.*** Whenever the shambling mound is subjected to Lightning damage, it regains a number of [Hit Points](rules/5e/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md) equal to the Lightning damage dealt.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The shambling mound makes three Charged Tendril attacks. It can replace one attack with a use of Engulf.

***Charged Tendril.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* `dice:1d20+7|noform|noparens|text(+7)`, reach 10 ft. *Hit:* `dice:1d6+4|noform|noparens|avg|text(7)` (`1d6 + 4`) Bludgeoning damage plus `dice:2d4|noform|noparens|avg|text(5)` (`2d4`) Lightning damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, the shambling mound pulls the target 5 feet straight toward itself.

***Engulf.*** *Strength Saving Throw:* DC 15, one Medium or smaller creature within 5 feet. *Failure:* The target is pulled into the shambling mound's space and has the [Grappled](rules/5e/conditions.md#Grappled) condition (escape DC 14). Until the grapple ends, the target has the [Blinded](rules/5e/conditions.md#Blinded) and [Restrained](rules/5e/conditions.md#Restrained) conditions, and it takes `dice:3d6|noform|noparens|avg|text(10)` (`3d6`) Lightning damage at the start of each of its turns. When the shambling mound moves, the [Grappled](rules/5e/conditions.md#Grappled) target moves with it, costing it no extra movement. The shambling mound can have only one creature [Grappled](rules/5e/conditions.md#Grappled) by this action at a time.
