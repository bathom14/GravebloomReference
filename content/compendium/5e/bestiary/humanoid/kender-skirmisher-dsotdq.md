# Kender Skirmisher
*Source: Dragonlance: Shadow of the Dragon Queen p. 204*  

Kender skirmishers are fearless fighters who use stealth and wiliness to defend their friends and homes. They excel at disrupting their enemies by sabotaging crucial equipment or by taunting opponents into making rash decisions. They wield the signature kender weapon: the hoopak, a combination spear and sling staff.

## Kender Taunts

| 2 | "I wish I could be like you and just not care how I look... or smell... or dress. So brave." |
| 3 | "Did the Cataclysm have a face? Because I think you might be twins!" |
| 4 | Energetically points at their foe with both hands and loudly repeats the word "bonk." |
