# Medusa
*Source: Mythic Odysseys of Theros p. 206*  

Medusas (often called gorgons on Theros) are closely associated with Pharika, the god of poison and medicine. Pharika has charged her favored servants with guarding secrets of life, health, and immortality that are too powerful to be known by those who lack the wisdom to use them properly. Those who approach a medusa with humility and worthy offerings might receive the creature's favor. The medusa might propose a dangerous quest to fetch some rare ingredient or legendary relic, promising to reward success with a bit of Pharika's knowledge. This information might lead to a cure for a plague, an alchemical breakthrough, or a secret of the cosmos.

## Traits

***Petrifying Gaze.*** When a creature that can see the medusa's eyes starts its turn within 30 feet of the medusa, the medusa can force it to make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw if the medusa isn't [incapacitated](rules/5e/conditions.md#Incapacitated) and can see the creature. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature is instantly [petrified](rules/5e/conditions.md#Petrified). Otherwise, a creature that fails the save begins to turn to stone and is [restrained](rules/5e/conditions.md#Restrained). The [restrained](rules/5e/conditions.md#Restrained) creature must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn, becoming [petrified](rules/5e/conditions.md#Petrified) on a failure or ending the effect on a success. The petrification lasts until the creature is freed by the  [greater restoration](compendium/5e/spells/greater-restoration.md) spell or other magic.

Unless [surprised](rules/5e/conditions.md#Surprised), a creature can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If the creature does so, it can't see the medusa until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If the creature looks at the medusa in the meantime, it must immediately make the save.

If the medusa sees itself reflected on a polished surface within 30 feet of it and in an area of bright light, the medusa is, due to its curse, affected by its own gaze.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The medusa makes either three melee attacks—one with its snake hair, one to constrict, and one with its shortsword—or two ranged attacks with its longbow.

***Snake Hair.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `dice:1d20+5|noform|noparens|text(+5)` to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* `dice:1d4+2|noform|noparens|avg|text(4)` (`1d4 + 2`) piercing damage plus `dice:4d6|noform|noparens|avg|text(14)` (`4d6`) poison damage.

***Shortsword.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `dice:1d20+5|noform|noparens|text(+5)` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* `dice:1d6+2|noform|noparens|avg|text(5)` (`1d6 + 2`) piercing damage.

***Longbow.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* `dice:1d20+5|noform|noparens|text(+5)` to hit, range 150/600 ft., one target. *Hit:* `dice:1d8+2|noform|noparens|avg|text(6)` (`1d8 + 2`) piercing damage plus `dice:2d6|noform|noparens|avg|text(7)` (`2d6`) poison damage.

***Constrict.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `dice:1d20+3|noform|noparens|text(+3)` to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* `dice:2d6|noform|noparens|avg|text(7)` (`2d6`) bludgeoning damage, and the target is [grappled](rules/5e/conditions.md#Grappled) (escape DC 11). Until this grapple ends, the target is [restrained](rules/5e/conditions.md#Restrained), and the medusa can't constrict another target.
