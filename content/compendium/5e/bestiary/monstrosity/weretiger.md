## Weretiger

*Changed by the Power of the Tiger*

- **Habitat.** Desert, Forest, Grassland  
- **Treasure.** Armaments  

Weretigers shape-shift from humanoid forms into tigers or tiger-humanoid hybrids. Although they can transform at will or when their magical nature demands, many weretigers are nocturnal and transform into their bestial shapes at night. Some weretigers' transformations might also be tied to the crescent moon, seasons, or momentous events. Weretigers often view their abilities as a blessing or a family honor, and they use their shape-shifting abilities to defend something with historic importance. Roll on or choose a result from the Weretiger Wards table to inspire what a weretiger defends.

If the target is a Humanoid, it is subjected to the following effect. *Constitution Saving Throw:* DC 13. *Failure:* The target is cursed. If the cursed target drops to 0 [Hit Points](rules/5e/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md), it instead becomes a Weretiger under the DM's control and has 10 [Hit Points](rules/5e/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md). *Success:* The target is immune to this weretiger's curse for 24 hours.
