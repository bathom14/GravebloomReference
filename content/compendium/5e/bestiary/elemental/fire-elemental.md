# Fire Elemental
*Source: Monster Manual (2024) p. 118, Dragon Delves. Available in the <span title='Systems Reference Document (5.2)'>SRD</span> and the Free Rules (2024)*  

## Fire Elemental

*Primal Spirit of Heat and Flame*

- **Habitat.** Desert, Planar (Elemental Plane of Fire)  
- **Treasure.** None  

Fire elementals arise when spirits of the Elemental Plane of Fire inhabit flames, burning cinders, and heated smoke. These beings are tangible despite largely being made of flames and particles, and they can uses their vague limbs to ignite foes and flammable materials. Fire elementals typically burn in shades of orange and red, but other colors are possible. Most on the Material Plane are summoned by magical means, or they might appear near rifts amid desert depths, volcanoes, wildfires, or magma flows that connect to their home plane.

Fire elementals might burn in distinctive ways. Roll on or choose a result from the Fire Elemental Compositions table to inspire a fire elemental's features.

***Fire Aura.*** At the end of each of the elemental's turns, each creature in a 10-foot [Emanation](rules/5e/variant-rules/emanation-area-of-effect-xphb.md) originating from the elemental takes `dice:1d10|noform|noparens|avg|text(5)` (`d10`) Fire damage.
