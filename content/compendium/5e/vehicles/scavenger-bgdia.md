# Scavenger
%%-- Embedded content starts on the next line. --%%
*Source: Baldur's Gate: Descent Into Avernus p. 219*  

The Scavenger handles like a small bus and is used to sift through battlefield detritus for scrap metal and other materials worth salvaging. Attached to the back of the vehicle is a swinging crane with an iron grappling claw fastened to the end of a winch and a 50-foot-long chain.

## Traits

**Crushing Wheels.** The Scavenger can move through the space of any Large or smaller creature. When it does, the creature must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or take `dice:3d10|noform|noparens|avg|text(16)` (`3d10`) bludgeoning damage and be knocked [prone](rules/5e/conditions.md#Prone). If the creature was already [prone](rules/5e/conditions.md#Prone), it takes an extra `dice:3d10|noform|noparens|avg|text(16)` (`3d10`) bludgeoning damage. This trait can't be used against a particular creature more than once each turn.

**Magic Weapons.** The Scavenger's weapon attacks are magical.

**Prone Deficiency.** If the Scavenger rolls over and falls [prone](rules/5e/conditions.md#Prone), it can't right itself and is [incapacitated](rules/5e/conditions.md#Incapacitated) until flipped upright.

## Action Stations

**Helm (Requires 1 Crew and Grants Three-Quarters Cover).** Drive and steer the Scavenger.

**Grappling Claw (Requires 1 Crew and Grants Half Cover).** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `dice:1d20+10|noform|noparens|text(+10)` to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. *Hit:* The target is [grappled](rules/5e/conditions.md#Grappled) (escape DC 12). If the target is a creature, it is [restrained](rules/5e/conditions.md#Restrained) until the grapple ends. The grappling claw can grapple only one target at a time, and the claw's operator can use a bonus action to make the claw release whatever it's holding.

**2 Harpoon Flingers (Each Station Requires 1 Crew and Grants Half Cover).** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* `dice:1d20+6|noform|noparens|text(+6)` to hit, range 120 ft., one target. *Hit:* `dice:2d8+1|noform|noparens|avg|text(10)` (`2d8 + 1`) piercing damage.
